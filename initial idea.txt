game called shooting chess

the idea is that we change chess mechanics a bit so there are complete new tatctics.

0. board and initial positions are the same
1. chess figures can move, atack and eat exach other by the same rules
2. in the begining of each move there is a new healing phase and shooting phase
3. all figures have hp set to values in the beggining of each move to: (pan - 1, knight - 3, bishop - 3, tower - 4, queen and king - 8)
4. healing stage - for each figure for all figures of the same color it can "attack" it adds to them +1 hp with a heacling green ball charge.
5. shooting stage - for each figure for all figures of another color it can attack it deducts from them -1 hp with a damaging red ball charge. If figures hp reaches 0 it dies.
6. regular chess move
7. game ends when king dies
